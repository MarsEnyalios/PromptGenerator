"Trust me. I'm not insulting you. I'm describing you."
"You're one of them now," she whispered softly. 
It's black and blue. The end. 
"I like my friends alive--but thanks for asking!"
"Midnight, on the bridge. Come alone."
"Well, if SOMEONE hadn't forgotten the coffee maker, we wouldn't be in this situation."
"Ah, comedic moments. Now can we get back to saving the world?"
"Fine. You can sit in the passenger's seat. Just don't jump out the window, okay?"
It bothered him that he was having an argument with an inanimate object
She had the circumference and personality of an end table.
When he opened the drawer, he saw it, but he knew it hadn't been there an hour ago.
She knew she needed to clean off the mantle but she couldn't bring herself to touch the things there.
The wrong daughter had the baby.
"Results may vary. Caution is advised."
"The windshield was purple. WE were purple. EVERYTHING was purple."
"Now how in the hell does a preacher know so much about crime?"
There was something so beautiful about her lost expression.
What's the point in algebra? I'm not a pirate, I don't need to find 'x'.
"I hate you so much right now."
"I swear, if one more person reaches in my pants pocket today...." 
Is that what you think of me? That I'm just some disposable nothing?
No, no, no--was that a touch? Yes, it was--oh, his leg--he screamed so hard his throat hurt. 
She found the small cat hiding under a bed in one of the rooms. 
"A watched pot never boils," said the man as he dropped a watch into a pot of water
"Run!" 
A bee hive falls out of the tree and lands on the ground beside him
A guy who refers to unborn babies as puppies
All she could think of was how much she wanted to choke him right now
Every night the old man dug holes in his lawn, "Some day I'll find it" he said.
He bought her a new kimono
He fell asleep while eating pizza and watching vampire movies
He says he only has 2 dogs, but I'm sure I saw 3 dogs
He turned and burst out laughing.
It was the biggest snake she had ever seen.
Seriously? That's what you are wearing?
She could think of nothing more sexy than a guy wearing eyeliner
She stomped angrily behind him, slipped in the mud and fell hard on her bum.
She suddenly found herself surrounded by pigeons
That night he dreamed of killer vampire pizza boys
The only plant they saw was a huge citrus tree behind the house
They camped under the tall cliff
They could hear the sound of swords clashing
The dreams in neon flicker and fade
"'I'm sorry, I was busy being cursed by a wicked witch. Does that count as a reason why I was tardy?"
"All I want is a taste of freedom. Is that too much to ask, after being caged like a pet bird? Or must I always wonder what freedom really tastes like?" 
"Are you really going to keep staring at me?" 
"Behind you." "Wha?" He turns, and immediately gets punched in the face.
"Being an idiot won't help you in any situation,"
"By dawn's early light you can finish the fight you began."
"Come and let us reason together."
"Come here so I can hit you again."
"Come with me," the boy urged. His eyes made me want to follow...
"Did it ever occur to you that some people might not be interested in getting naked with you?" 
"Did you really think you could get away with it?" "Well, no, but I did succeed in doing it, didn't I?" 
"Do it!"
"Do you know how hard it is not to just stab you in the chest?" 
"Do you smell that?" 
"Don't let the makeup fool you, it's just war paint for women."
"Don't look now, but I think we have a watcher."
"Don't you remember how your last love life went?"
"Eight o' clock is far too early to start interrogating people."
"Either we stand, or we fall!"
"Either you tell me what happened, or I break your nose again." 
"Enlighten me," the man growled.
"Every kid is a friend, every friend a brother."
"Every move that she makes makes me feel like never before!"
"Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell me which way to Hell?"
"Gawking like that makes you look stupid."
"Get that thing away from me!" the girl yelled. 
"Go to your window right now, and look carefully at the street below; I'm sure you'll see what I'm talking about." 
"Good boys don't scare girls away." "Oh, shut the hell up. Good boys end up dead in ditches."
"Have a terrible day! Don't come again!" she said with a bright smile on her face as he walked out 
"He died. Murdered actually."
"He knew them! That's why he killed himself!" 
"He said if I didn't fight back . . . he said he'd let her live." 
"He should have never been there in the first place."
"Hey! I resemble that comment!"
"Hey. I'm a dead person, who're you?"
"How about you come over for some tea and I'll help you with that dog you call your husband, love?"
"How can you buy the sky?" 
"How do you know about that? Er, I mean I have no idea what you are talking about!"
"How was I suppose to know that SMILING meant I'd have his children?!"
"I always thought Eve got a bad rap. After all, she's not the only woman whose ever fallen for a smooth talking snake."
"I am trying to interrogate someone here!"
"I ask for the position of warrior."
"I can scream over and over 'I'm not insane, I'm not insane, I'm not' and no one will ever believe me because I don't fit into their frame of sanity." 
"I could have been out slaughtering people for all I know!"
"I couldn't very well run in a dress, you idiot."
"I didn't do it on purpose, despite how the angels saw it."
"I distinctly recall you saying you wanted to kill me." 
"I have something to tell you. Now, don't freak out."  
"I killed you myself!"
"I knew it would be crazy…" 
"I know an agent when I see one. You're too obvious.""Who said I was trying to hide?" 
"I like to travel in pairs."
"I LOVE YOU!' she screamed, knowing that he couldn't possibly hear it. 
"I see before me a new horizon."
"I stabbed him with a knife. It was as brutal as it sounds."
"I think I need to find a different occupation..."
"I think the man staring at me doesn't have a soul."
"I thought you were alone."
"I woke up with a shovel drenched with blood in my hand, and there was a trail of blood leading up to me!"
"I'll be back in a minute; I have to go catch a falling star."
"I'll never go away." "You'll never /get/ away."
"I'll take...you. Name your price." 
"If anyone comes looking for you, they'll have to talk to the lady of the house first, and I won't let them in."
"If he is awake early enough and the boy sees…" 
"In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn."
"Is it really a sin, to steal from a thief? To kill the murderer? Unfortunately, I didn't get the opportunity to ask this." 
"It wasn't her fault."
"It's generally frowned upon to promote the murdering of a fellow student."
"It's not difficult to set an effective trap; all you need is the right bait." Abby grinned. "We have that." 
"It's not wise to let someone like me know your name."
"Just give me time. I need to stop--stop loving you, like this. And then we'll see."
"Kid, I've seen some things in my life but that was something I thought I'd never see!"
"Kill someone. That always seems to cheer you up."
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your inevitable demise."
"Look to the sky."
"Lovely. I am travelling with two wanted outlaws."
"My lady, do you actually need all these clothes?"
"My name is [name]," he said, trying to sound relaxed and supremely confident despite the circumstances. "And I'm here looking for you."
"Oh great. Another looney bucket."
"Oh, hello! I didn't see you there."
"Oh. I thought you were alone . . ."
"Okay. You have thirty seconds to explain what happened to my coffee maker."
"People all make mistakes. Some people learn from it, some people don't. I just happen to be one of those who never learns from mistakes."
"Report back to me."
"Seeing people tied up in the street is a much more common occurrence in this place than one might be accustomed to."  
"She almost believed me." 
"She's his apprentice, and he can do whatever he wants."
"She's my sister. And she's going to skin me alive."
"Something tells me the tide will be turning."
"Sometimes I wonder about you."
"That looked like it hurt." 
"The boy must be killed."
"The first clue I had that I had woken up somewhere else was the sunlight."  
"The good news is I found your boyfriend. The bad news is . . . he's probably dead." 
"The only thing that you need to know is that I am higher than you, and what I say goes."
"The power to be strong, the wisdom to be wise,"
"The women of this family . . ." 
"There was a crack--and they disappeared, gone, never to return."
"There's a world I need to know"
"They were never meant to die!"
"Think about it for a minute. It'll come to you."
"This Dog bites." I growled at the guard. 
"This is like a bad game of scrabble."
"This is terribly unorthodox."
"Touch me."
"We lost one." 
"We were broken people. All of us. Broken people trying to fix the world."
"We're going over the wall."
"We're going there." "No we're not." "It isn't an option." 
"We're not lost, we're on an adventure." 
"Weird? Me? No, I just have this thing called personality." 
"Welcome to the unending."
"Well, I do believe I am."
"Well . . . I've got a girl locked in there," he said, noticing how weird it sounded. 
"What are you all yelling at me for?! He did it!"
"What are you doing?"
"What do you think I'm doing, wrapping her side in medical tape for the fun of it? I'm treating her wounds, idiot." 
"What goes to hell stays in hell."
"What if you had a thousand wishes, but each one had a trick?"
"What if you're lying to me about that too?"
"Whatever you do, I'll do it too."
"When, in third grade, I told my teacher I wanted to grow up to be a fairy princess, this wasn't how I imagined it."
"Where'd that laundry basket come from?"
"Who made you my travelling companion? Are we even going to the same place?" 
"Why are you following me?"
"Would you believe me if I told you that I had owl wings?" 
"Yeah, but that does not change the fact that you're eleven."
"You broke my heart, allow me to break your arm."
"You can't outrun death," the shadow said. 
"You can't tell me what to do! You're dead!"
"You did WHAT?" 
"You do realize that struggling is useless."
"You don't understand what it's like to have to fight to be recognized for who you are and what you've done right instead of what you are and what you did wrong when you were young and stupid."
"You keep telling yourself that."
"You know you are going to jail if they catch you writing, right?" 
"You know...there is nothing as tempting as a locked door."
"You look even better up close than you do through my telescope."
"You make the cutest noises when you sleep!"
"You never did do it the easy way."
"You of all people know that there's no where to run." 
"You shouldn't sleep so close to the road, kid. Someone could have robbed you." 
"You soldiers tend to over do it."
"You sure know how to hold a grudge." 
"You thought I was joking, didn't you?"
"You two kidnapped me and you don't even know who I am?"
"You were flirtin' with death, and you shoulda been flirtin' with me." 
"You! Get out of the gene pool!" 
"You're not one of us, are you?" 
"You're not upset about how I killed you that one time, right?" 
"There is no use running. There is nowhere to go." Don paused to allow his statement to sink in. "You might as well sit down and rest. Then we…" 
"'Why' is never a good question," the dragon said. "You'll never get the answer you want to hear." 
"Fiction is the truth inside the lie." 
"Go back to sleep, kid," He called over his shoulder, "And hope the cold takes you before a bandit does."
"Let me help you." He took my arm, but I jerked away.
"Make yourself inconspicuous." 
"No," he told her, raising his chin just a little in defiance.
"Okay, so love spells. A love spell is kind of how it started."
"Stop, you're killing him!" she cried helplessly. 
'Really?' she asked, bemused, skewering her mouth to the side. 'That's all you want to know?'
"...why am I on your 'to do' list?"
"I don't want a knight in shinin' armor, I want a knight in dulled armor with the dings and dust from a long adventure. 
"I had a dream." "That tends to happen when you sleep."
"It feels good between my fingers."
"No, I can't explain, you're just going to have to come with us. Sorry. Protocol."
"Stay calm and perfectly still and we might get out of here alive."
"Stop touching it. ... I said STOP TOUCHING IT!"
"There is no sky."
"Who are you trying to convince sweetheart? Me, or yourself?"
"Why I need her is of no matter to you."
All I wanted to do was sleep and escape this nightmare in my dreams. 
As her head hit the floor and the world dimmed around her, she could have sworn she heard laughter. But that couldn't be right...
Character says name. "Is that a disease?"
Combat has only one law – if you die, you lose. 
Darkness was fast approaching. This was her final chance.
Everything is going to be okay.
Excuse me, but why is there a diamond necklace dangling from your pocket?
Finally, I realized why he was acting like that. How could I have been so blind?
He tried to breathe, but the air wouldn't come
He wanted to see what she was really like, wanted to see how she acted when her mask was down
Her body relaxed, even as her mind screamed to keep fighting it, whatever it was.
I could hear them whispering about me 
I should stop working night shifts. I'm starting to see things.
I was on the floor. I didn't know how I had gotten there, but I knew that I was on the floor. The floor seemed like a bad place to be right now. I didn't want to be on the floor. How had I gotten onto the floor?
If he'd known the day would end with a split lip and both of his arms being broken, he might have gone back to bed. Maybe. 
It was bright and blinding and made her eyes water, the prickling at the corners of her eyes becoming almost unbearable because she couldn't rub them.
It was just a dream, just a horrible dream.
Just keep moving
Looks are deceiving
My head wasn't pounding, it was on the verge of collapsing on itself
She looked at him with pleading eyes. "Please, only this time..." she begged.
Slowly her vision came back to her, and she took a deep breath of air to steady herself before standing up again. As she started the rise, the same dizzying sensation came over her, and she obediently slid back down again.
Sorry, but this is EXACTLY what this looks like.
The call comes at 3:20 AM. I know it's not good. Nothing good comes to you at 3:20 in the morning.
The name plays on her lips and is brushed away by the wind as she looks up at the clouds.
There was only one chink in her armor
Though it was neither the place nor the time, [Character name] just had to burst into song.
Where do I go from here?"
It was one of those days when everything is normal all the way through breakfast, and right up until you walk out the front door... 
A blast of steam suddenly hit the window panes, fogging them up and sending a young man sprawling backwards onto the floor. As the fog waded away, the image of a large scaly blue head appeared. 
A bloodcurdling scream ripped through the night and s/he froze. 
A dagger hung at his side, a jewel gleaming at it's hilt.
A mysterious box was sitting on the doorstep.
A stranger was knocking at the door
A trail of blood decorated the floor
After a few minutes of blinking away unconsciousness, [MC]'s most pressing concern was not, as one might imagine, how he had ended lying unconscious in a ditch to the side of the road. 
After about ten minutes of this, I came to the conclusion that something had gone horribly wrong.
After the search party checked the field,
After two hours, she knew he wouldn't be coming. 
All MC wanted wanted was a drink and there were eight armed men between him/her and the bar. 
Almost every step creaked, setting her teeth on edge.
Although her neighbor had always been friendly,
Among the crowd of on-lookers,
An injured body is better than an injured mind. But my unrelenting pain on the elbow was making a mockery of that line.
An old storyteller 
And even as she broke through she felt it tug down, and before she knew what to do she was under once again.
And the crowd went wild. They panicked and screamed and some even ran in circles. Name lowered his gun. "Oops." 
And then he walked towards the same mountain for the last time. This time nobody could change his mind
And this time, she did scream.
And when I looked over, he was smiling. 
Andrew didn't even have to open his eyes to know they were here. 
Apparently pepper spray works on anyone, including vampires.
As Name swam into the realm of consciousness, the first thing she felt was a powerful throbbing in her left arm. 
As soon as his hand touched the ball,
As soon as she closed her eyes,
At age 13 I fell in love with someone who was perfect except for one flaw - he wasn't real 
Attending your own funeral.
Before you turn me into a pet project to sate your curiosity, at least learn my name first.
Behind his smiling face and eyes, 
Bending over to pick up the fragile shell,
Better to die than to crawl
Blood dripped down from her hands. She wiped them on her pants and glanced around. It was night, so the darkness hid the stains on her pants. She shivered. She still was in shock that she had survived and her friend Josh had not. She needed to keep running, that was the only thing keeping her alive. 
Blood had already formed a pool around the corpse of the guard, and Asenette took a step back, sickened. 
But there was something more lethal about a gun right behind you - something more final; the endgame became real.
But there were none to be found
Byrony felt someone watching her as soon as she... 
C1: 'I need to get something off my chest.' C2: 'Is it your shirt? Please say no.'
C1: 'What the heck are you doing here?' C2: 'I should ask you the same question.' C1: 'I work here!' C2: 'I should ask you a different question.'
C1: "Are you ever gonna talk to me again?" C2: "Probably not."
C1: "Hear that?" C2: "No, nothing." C1: "That´s exactly it. Creepy, isn´t it?" 
C1: "Where's your homework?" C2: "The werewolf ate it while it was in my backpack." C1: "Nice try but there are no such things as-- WEREWOLVES!!"
C1: Sometimes I feel like I should apologize to him/her for being a jerk.C2: Really? /skeptical C1: Don't worry it passes.
C1: Yes, well, it seems almost inevitable from where I'm standing. C2: You're sitting. 
C1: You're insane." C2: Do you know, I have been told that, on occasion. And it hasn't failed me yet.
Character 1: "I can only be a gentleman for so long." Character 2: "I thought you'd stop being one sooner." Character 1: "Less talking, more kissing."
It's too happy.
Conversation should be pleasant without scurrility, witty without affectation, free without indecency, learned without conceitedness, novel without falsehood. 
Create a legend, myth, or fairytale about falling stars 
Daniel gave a polite cough. It didn't attract the attention he wanted. He cleared his throat, took a deep breath and reached for the bell. It was now or never. 
Do you know what the birds and animals say? 
Don cowered under the hedge, trembling, ribs heaving as he fought to control his breathing as silently as possible. 
Don't talk to me about Chocolate Cake
Ducking beneath her desk,
During her favorite time of day,...
Even if she hadn't lost the book, 
Even the tips of her hair seemed to curl in hatred when she saw him. 
Everyone speaks freely in front of the family pet. If only they knew there were those who can communicate with our furry friends. 
Fear paralyzed her the moment he arrived at The Gathering. A bond between Master and servant wasn't easily broken. 
Fly, be free!
For a moment, she could only stare straight ahead, the vivid images still before her, images of blood and death and darkness and evil.
For some reason, he could not shake the feeling that she was laughing at him, behind his back.
For the past thirty minutes she had been quietly working her hands free from the tape he had bound her with.
Four men (who don't speak english) have been at your FMC's house for hours, putting in a window. Your FMC is hiding in a closet. 
Francisco was rather confused. He was being sat upon by a dragon, however, dragons did not exist. 
Gee, since I would be so inclined to keep to my promise if I were going to be dead in a minute.
Gina stared at the doctor. Her mind churned in confusion. How could she… 
Girl is what you call an ugly misfit; an odd stranger comes and says he'll make her pretty on one condition: She does whatever he says. Thinking of her crush (That's also her sister's boyfriend) She says yes. Then the man forces her on a rampage of killing and if she defies him he literally gets in her head. 
Harry was puzzled when the door didn't open. 
He and I were tied together by something bigger than us both.
He blocked her path, not minding that she aimed a kick at him.
He couldn't believe that the girl had outsmarted him
He definitely wouldn't believe her now.
He didn't like being left out of things, and he was feeling very left out at the moment.
He flicked the cap casually, not noticing when it hit some girl's back.
He grasped for it, feeling it barely brush against the tips of his fingers, and then it was gone. 
He had been taught by his parents that the animal that has carried you always comes first.
He had been thinking about leaving the farm anyway, since he was of age and he did not want to be a farm boy for the rest of his life.
He knew he was screwing with her head. The plan was to screw with it until it was screwed on straight. 
He leaned back in satisfaction, pleased with his work.
He loved his country and wanted to do the best to serve it and its king.
He must have known and trusted whoever it was that had killed him.
He muttered something about 'women' under his breath. 
He peered into the coffin and smiled, wondering if he would be the first person to ever consider that this might be the most splendid hiding place. 
He reveled in the fact that all of these people were so ignorant.
He sat up, the blankets falling off of him, wincing as he rubbed the spot in which his head had made contact with the floor. 
He sauntered through the doorway, a self-satisfied grin on his face. "Remember our little problem? It's been solved." 
He scowled again when he saw where the meeting was to be held place at
He shook his head. "No, the third door stays closed." 
He shot the girl a dirty look that said 'Just whose side are you on anyway?'
He sighed as he looked around one last time at his house
He stealthily strolled through the market, looking for someone suitable for his needs.
He tried to remember who had talked him into this.
He was a man of the shadows
He was going to topple their perfect little kingdom.
He was good looking, but annoying. The type that was far more attractive when he kept his mouth shut.
He was the one in charge of the investigations of the murders, and of course he was not getting anywhere close, but John's level of being annoyance was very low.
He was trying to get past her arms, to get to her inner circle.
He watched the house burn to the ground with no small sense of satisfaction.
He'd never noticed the diner on that street before. Had it always been there? 
Her feet swiftly ran across the cobblestone. Her heart pounded. Over the roar of her heart she could hear his feet pounding the pavement. She hoped he would tire soon. Adrenaline raced through her, making any weariness go away. If she was to survive this night, she needed to find someone to help her escape. 
Her foot slipped and she started to fall. 
Heretic. Murderer. Every day, Izra heard them whispering it as she passed. 
His favorite table was, of course, occupied by some girl
His fingers were cold and she shivered slightly as they brushed against her cheek. 
His stride had a furious click to it, and he seemed to be positively glowering.
His thoughts at that moment were probably something along the lines of, What did I do wrong this time?
His/her eyes were locked onto mine, I couldn't look away even if I wanted to. 
How do I get past this? Everything was going so well until today  
How to survive on an alien planet? Well, it would have been smarter of me to land somewhere else...
Hurrying away and looking directly at no one,
I always get annoyed when people ask me my name and then look at me like I'm insane when I tell them.
I am a murderer. I am a traitor to my king and to my country. I am a dead man. 
I could feel his eyes on me, watching me. I felt a chill run up my spine when I realized that there was no way to escape his gaze.
I could feel the poison traveling through my veins, fusing with my own blood. 
I could feel the rumble like a strong black wind.
I cowered in the corner, realizing in terror my absurd fear of the dark had not been so senseless after all. 
I glanced back as I ran, and saw the castle in flames. It looked radiant and beautiful, but it was on fire. What had I done? An arrow whizzed past my ears, meant to hit me. People were after me, they knew it was me. I had destroyed my own kingdom, killed it all. I kept running and saw a figure up ahead...
I look to the sky, know that the day will have horrible weather and yet I still think that this might be a good day
I looked at my fork, contemplating if anyone would notice me stab it into his throat. 
I pushed passed people, ignoring their complaints, I tripped and stumbled a couple of times, but righted myself. I could hear him shouting behind me, running to catch up.
I saw him, on the pedestal, but one thing was off. He had a rope around his neck. 
I searched. I really did.
I tried to make my way around him, but he stepped in front of me, and demanded to know my name.
I was kidnapped, and frankly, I'm lucky to be here at all.
I was not expecting what was waiting for me just as I rounded the corner. 
I was only supposed to be gone for three days.  
I was wanted for, amongst other things, murder on three continents 
I woke up. I was in the dungeon.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was like, secretly a nap crime-lord.
I'd always imagined that a talking dog would have a deeper voice. 
I'll not be overshadowed; mine is not the lesser light!
I'm gay.
I've always admired her ability to skirt certain topics.
I've never been a very good sniper, but I'll give this a shot.
I've waited long enough now for them all to come around!
If she was going to commit suicide, she was going to do it the smart way.
If you can't sleep, instead of counting sheep, try talking to the sheperd.
Ignoring the bloodstains on his shirt, she asked "How was your day?" 
In hindsight, the hat really should have tipped me off. 
Is that a free couch out there on the sidewalk? 
It had just been here, and now we couldn't find it.
It is a lesson which all history teaches wise men, to put trust in ideas, and not in circumstances. 
It looked dead, but I began to back away just in case. 
It really was awkward to be having a conversation like that for him, because it did not sound very moral.
It was a bright and sunny day, though with the chain of events that I inadvertently set off, a dark and stormy night would most definitely be a more suitable setting. 
It was a dark and stormy night. Okay, it wasn't. It was a bright and sunny morning, but that just doesn't sound the same. 
It was a dark and stormy night. Okay, it wasn't. It was a bright and sunny morning, but that just doesn't sound the same. 
It was probably the reason for him getting killed.
It was the scariest thing she had ever seen.
It's not like the killer is going to say, "Yeah, I'm here in the kitchen. You want a sandwich?"
It's not the street I usually go down. But for some reason, that day I turned down a different road. 
It's a small thing, so insignificant she normally would have overlooked it, but she'd had a long day and her patience has long since snapped. 
John is not one to suffer fools easily. Only last week he… 
Kim bolted down the hallway.
Late-night laughter on a city street always made her nervous
Lian shut her eyes again and pushed him — it? — away by the shoulders. "Now you need to learn about personal boundaries. And clothing."
Like a crazy person, ...
Listening through the wall, he could hear foot steps patrolling the hallway. 
Men at some time are masters of their fates: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings. 
Most people knew they were going to have a bad day when they woke up in a straight jacket. {Character} knew it was either a Tuesday or Grandma had gotten into the liquor cabinet again.
Mother earth does not carry about your character's petty problems. She will throw down a hurricane, flood, famine, or pestilence at a whim. What can mother nature do to make the current situation more annoying? 
Murder was not just a lifestyle, it was a game, and one that they were particularly good at.
My best friend is dead, she's been that way for a while.
My kitten's missing! 
Nadika was glad to be officially alive again, but she wished she didn't have to be alive in the king's antechamber 
Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power. 
Never, ever bring this up again, she says
No one had ever heard the wind blow like this before.
No one has good in them. We are all bad people, who sometimes make good choices.
No one is allowed on the thriteenth room.
No one knew why they called it the Singing Rocks--true, the wind did make noises as it wound through the honeycombs, but the screams and wails could hardly be called singing.
Not everything needs to be attacked on sight. Things might have turned out better if someone had told us that at the beginning.
Of all the places for Gwen to have a wizard's tower, the dolt chose the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest. 
Okay, stay calm. Just because you woke up in a forest does not mean anything bad.
On Tuesday, the rain stopped.
Once you leave this place, you can never come back. Things will never be the same. Neither choice is completely bad, nor completely good. But choose carefully. 
One foot in the door, a jolt ran through her, and she knew she immediately wanted to turn around again and run.
Past the edge of the city,
Play from your heart.
Reaching forward to break his fall,
Rings on her fingers 
Rosalie stifled her scream and cowered under the blanket. 
Run with me! Run!'
Running down the street, the man held back a sob. He wasn't prone to crying, but today was an exception.
Sally sat up in her bed. She was positive she heard a noise. Something that didn't belong… 
Servants were scurrying past every minute or so.
Seven Boxes
Shaking her head defiantly,
She backed up, falling and landing on her butt. Oddly enough it was soft beneath her.
She didn't know what it was, but she knew that she didn't want to be its lunch. 
She didn't see it coming.
She died in his arms too many times to count. 
She felt like everyone in the inn was watching her.
She fought like a rabid hellhound but she was mine.
She found herself clinging to the shadows, and creeping along as if she was some criminal.
She had been warned, but now it was too late.
She hadn't even known those were there, and she was the one sleeping in the room.
She jumped as I opened the door. 
She knew there was no way around this, short of a miracle.
She knew this time around that it was in this place.
She might have been a real person for all of her complaining about her family's destitution.
She nodded shakily to herself, looking at the blood encrusted shovel, wondering why someone would try to kill some one with a shovel.
She positioned the knife so that it would go straight to her heart without much interference or pain.
She released the hilt of the spear in horror at what she had just done. Yes, something else was controlling her, but it was in her body. She had done it.
She rolled over and felt her body push up against something hard and solid. 
She sauntered out of the room, the strange cat pressed to her chest and frying pan in the other hand.
She shivered, and searched for the blankets on the bed to pull over her
She simply did not have enough self control to starve herself to death.
She slapped him. 
She smacked the other man hard across the face, because the idiot should have seen that coming. 
She spun around striking out with her knives.
She stared at the bloke with disgust and then turned to the maid, standing beside the door, making a vague gesture with her hand towards _____. "Put the rubbish out, will you? And make sure it stays there."
She stood upon the edge of infinity, gazing into it with grim anticipation. She jumped. 
She thought she caught a hint of a smile, but it was gone so quick that she was sure she had imagined it.
She tore through the alley, ducked into a doorway, and tried to squeeze into nothingness. 
She touched the little box in her pocket and smiled.
She was very not happy at her father
She was very upset with him.
She watched his lithe body saunter away. "You're engaged," she reminded herself. 
She went slowly down the stairs, taking each step carefully, stepping next to the wall so as to let them not creak or make a noise.
She whimpered again, and pulled she legs closer to her.
Shifting her glance to the side of the chair she noticed a small green box
Sipping from the glass of water she had poured him, it never passed his mind that she might have laced it with poison.
Sitting on the train, the man ran his fingers through his brown hair. He was trying to stay calm, but it was getting hard. He glanced over at the captors who were holding everyone hostage. They were conversing in some foreign language. The man glanced at his watch. They had been held captive now for almost five hours. 
Some people just need to die. 
Someone finding themselves in the middle of a strange forest, with no knowledge of how they got there, should be a bit more troubled by it.
Someone was in the house. 
Something about him breathed violence
Something brushed up against my foot.
Something had always been off about this person, but never more so then now
Something moved in the cupboard.
Something was waiting for them in the dark. 
Sophia wondered how she could possibly have failed to notice his eyes before: one blue, the other a pale brown.
Spring was just around the corner which meant it would soon be the annual Tulip festival. The whole town was buzzing with the preparations. 
Stretching his neck to see better,
Sucked into another demension and can't go home
Suddenly, he heard the whistling of steel cutting through air and turned, throwing out his sword.
Suddenly, nothing happened – but it happened suddenly. 
That door had always been closed. So why was it open today?
That left only herself. There was no one else in the city that he would trust enough to let them come near him and get him so easily.
That was the first moment I saw him, standing out of the crowd like a dark slash in the middle of white silk.
That... that just bored me. Is this what being bored feels like? How strange... 
That's great. Now put your shirt back on.
The bright light blinded Karen momentarily, just before she fainted. 
The chattering birds made her smile, until she heard a growl. 
The door slammed behind him.
The dragon seemed to grin, fangs glittering in the dim torchlight.
The dream stealer made his way forward and placed a finger in the blood.
The dusty, old book was sitting there, just begging to be read.
The floorboard creaked.
The footprints in the snow suddenly ended.
The girl carried an umbrella even though there wasn't a cloud in the sky
The kid ran fast. His legs pumped and he pushed himself past the point of pain. He needed to get away.
The knife was cold in my hand.
The locked door fascinated and puzzled her.
The man dressed in all gray prowled down the alley way.
The man laughed loudly at a joke that only he had heard.
The man on the doorstep was soaked, water dripping from his overcoat and evaporating the moment it hit the dusty, sun-drenched porch. 
The metalwork was very nice - the copper was freshly polished and very well welded. However, my appreciation of it was somewhat mitigated by the fact that they were my handcuffs. 
The ones that have already lost everything are the ones you should fear the most. They have nothing left to lose and thus nothing to hold them back.
The path split again. Why did they not have any straight pathways around here? Just to frustrate him?
The people there were all sick. If he had the will, he would burn down the entire area, with all the sick people in it.
The prickles on his neck told him he was being watched.
The scream was beautiful. 
The stupid bird just wouldn't leave him alone.
The sudden change in wind direction caught Carol by surprise. 
The sun may plead and threaten!
The sun rose, glittering off the blood drenched cobblestones.
The taller of the two gentlemen had his back to Robert, but the shorter of the two (by a considerable margin) was staring right up at Robert, lips pulled back from blackened teeth in a vicious grin that told Robert everything he needed to know 
The train was late today, and it was always early.
The voices in my head won't let me sleep.
The wind and warmth of the sun sunk into her bones, even as they pushed her farther away from home. 
The window was broken. 
The young man's eyes snapped open. He swore he just heard someone cry in distress. He listened intently. Again, he heard it. It was coming from his head…some kind of strange connection. 
There are cages, and there are cages. My own hand closes the door on mine, and that makes all the difference.
There are more important things, and less important things, but it's a small brown kitten with eyes the color of snow that catches his attention. 
There was no way that this innocent looking young girl could have so mercilessly slaughtered tens of people.
There was only one consistency that he could discern in these voices, and that was the one lady's voice he had been hearing for months on end.
There was silence. 
There were five of them; standing on the narrow walkway of the bridge and watching the cars go past with solemn faces.
There were so many people.
There were some people who walked with a spring to their step, and he scowled at these people, thinking that they had no reason to be happy
There's suddenly a loud crash from the kitchen. 
These emotions I never knew!
They crinkled their noses, wondering what could make the room smell like this.
They had never seen anyone fight a woman before.
They stared at each other for a second, and then both raced for the bag.
They stumble upon a massive field of red flowers
They were walking along the river path… 
They won't see him.
This is for the ones who stood their ground.
This time, shoot the messanger.
This wasn't the kind of place you hoped to wake up in, especially not with the distinct ache of bound wrists and ankles
Thomas couldn't believe nobody else had noticed the cloud.
"Thunder clapped against the sky. The girl shuddered. She knew something was out there in the night. Something that shouldn't be."
Tiffany was tired of saying she was sorry. Her father was unrelenting, and she had had enough, starting today she would not apologize for something she didn't do, period. 
Tomorrow dawns in darkness!
Torsen, the young squad leader, found he did not believe her
Twins are rarely both born alive; the stronger cubs consume their shadow selves and emerge complete or not at all. 
Under no circumstances was I allowed to hold the sword.
Unlike her older brother,
Unlike the rest of the ones she had seen, whose eyes betrayed that they all lived to die in a blaze, this imp, this human child carrying the devil in her, had bright, dangerous, living eyes. 
Upon a chair of solid gold,
Upon waking up I remembered two things: one, that I still had an angel tied up in my basement, and two, that I really didn't care. 
Visere closed his eyes as a spasm of pain crossed his face.
Walking suddenly and without any explanation,
Walking through the forest was probably a bad idea.
Watch how the mighty will fall
We don't talk about number 44.
Wednesdays were worse than Mondays for two reasons
Well, I am growing wings. I think that it's entitled to hurt a bit. 
Well, the pen is mightier than the sword, but a baseball bat can be pretty effective too.'
Welts the size of silver dollars branded her arms. 
What if the killer is in the dark room?
What if the world was all reversed, and friends were really your enemies?
When his heartbeat returned to normal,
When I woke up, it was spring, and like it or not, I was 16 
When the car stopped directly in front of me,
Whenever he stepped on that part of the floor,
While she searched desperately for the map,
Who cares how good the words are when they come out? 
Why shouldn't they adore me?
With that, Keima pushed her to the ground, breathing heavily as he pinned her arms down.
Worst of all, it was all splattered with blood.

Write a story about a demon (or angel) that becomes fiercely protective of a young girl, and appears as a small black (or white) cat. 
You are in your house alone, and you could almost swear that there is someone behind you. It gives you an odd burst of speed, and you run into the next room, slamming the door behind you.
You are wearing your skin all wrong
You honestly expect me to believe you carved your way out of jail using a dead man's teeth? 
You know something is wrong when you walk into a room and everyone suddenly falls silent. 
You should not be here. Why do you not turn away? You must. I will be the death of you, I swear it. Run while you can 
You wake up. Brr, it's cold, you think. You open your eyes to see the early morning sun, the beautiful mountains, and the tree branches swaying above you… 
You walk down a long hall, the water drips down the stone walls on either side. The smell of decay surrounds you, and the damp air is almost stifling. Moving forward your light flickers into a large room, the darkness above swallowing up any light. In the middle of the room you see a chest, worn with age, but the metalwork still reflects your image… 
You seared my tongue off!
I feel like Dracula, and you just held up a cross.
Let me eat my papaya in peace!
C1: You're really disturbed, you know that?" C2: "That's why you love me." C1: "Shut up."
C1: "For my best friend, he sure is kind of stupid." C2: "That's because you two share a brain cell."
Who needs pants to be a pizza delivery driver?
C1: "How on Earth does that lava lamp work?" C2: "Why? Revisting the sixties?"
And this is our cat. Mom calls her Kiki. You can call her evil bitch.
Why the hell are you sitting in my car naked?
Last time we got in this situation, you went home with my underwear in your pocket.
I didn't mean to kil her. She just wouldn't listen!
I think I'm going to jump this time. I think I've finally hit my breaking point.
C1: "You never told me no!" C2: "I never said 'yes' either."
You ask 'why me' all the time. Have you ever thought to ask 'why not'?
Loyalty is never going to be your weakness, is it?
You think you've got it bad? My mother just told me I remind her of how she was at my age.
Look, I know we just met, but you seriously need some new shoes.
Did you just eat that? You know what? I don't want to know.
Your definition of cuddly needs revision.
Falling in love is like falling asleep. It happens very, very slowly and then all at once.
I'm not sure why I hate you so intensly. I'll have to review the evidence.
I feel like rabid bunnies with hammers are attacking my skull.
How does it feel to know that your whole life has been a lie?
C1: "There was a spider here just a second ago." C2: "Well, where did it go?" C1: "...I'm not sure..."
C1: "What do you mean there's something in the mirror?" C2: "Something noved in it, and it wasn't me."
C1: "Still want me?" C2: "Like a drug." C1: "How romantic."
I love the smell of fresh coconuts.
That cockroach was my friend, you sadistic bastard!
Honey, stop it. You can't speak cat.
I hate you but I don't want you to die.
C1: "You're my brother and I love you." C2: "But-" C1: "You are my BROTHER and I LOVE you."
C1: "You really should know better." C2: "I should, shouldn't I?"
If I gave you a million dollars, would you walk to Alaska barefoot?
C1: "Out of a litter of puppies you would take the one that is making duck sounds at a wilted plant while chewing on it's left hind paw." C2: "That's beside the point."
C1: "Did you know germs fall from the sky?" C2: "I'm never going to feel clean again."
I could kill you with a paperclip,while wearing a suit, and you'd foot the dry cleaning bill when I finished.
C1: "Well,I think we all know who would win 'Most Likely to Become a Serial Killer'." C2: "Yeah, I'd totally kill people."
Hey, remember how my little brother is a genius?
Okay, I don't mind you falling asleep your youre head on my chest, but could you snore less?
Well that was awkward. Who wants a waffle?
Seriously? You expect me to go in there?
Ah, comedic moments. Now, can we get back to saving the world?
Some people are meant to be in love, but not love each other.
I have NOTHING to apologize for!
C1: "I love you." C2: "I love me too."
She knew she needed to clean off the mantle but she couldn't bring herself to touch the things there.
C1: "On a scale of one to ten, your interest in me ranks at about a -5." C2: "It's more of a 1.3." C1: "That much? I'm touched."
I don't know how to dance or be funny or be romantic, but you should date me anyway.
C1: "I can't believe I didn't think of that!" C2: "I can."
If I kill you in your sleep, it's your fault.
C1: I'm just going to go cry a river over there." C2: "You can cry two rivers for all I care." C1: "One can't possibly cry that much. You'd have to drink a lot of water for that."
Mondays do not deserve a capital letter.
Spandex was not designed to be 'crotch friendly'.
YOLO: You obviously love owls.
The situation required heavy application of penguin pajamas, hot chocolate, and a moive involving angsty super heroes.
See? I'm like a bridge. An old, dusty, burning bridge over a giant kiddie pool filled with sharks. Oh, and the sharks are swimming in cranberry flavored jell-o.
C1: "Can your boat outrun my ex-girlfriend?" C2: "Of course! Why do you think I built this boat?"
My mind is like a steel trap...rusty and illegal in 49 states.
Why isn't there an option where I calmly offer the homicidal maniac a cookie? Everyone's more reasonable once they've had a cookie. Besides, maybe I'd get lucky and he'd be allergic to walnuts.
But I almost never follow through on my dumb and impulsive ideas! How many 17-years-olds can you say that about? Heck, how many 25-year-olds can you say that about? I have more than earned a little idiotic impulsiveness.
C1: "If everyone in the world except for the people in this room were vaporized, what would you do?" C2: "Reproduce." C1: "Speak for yourself."

But if you kill me I'll go extinct!
Mass suicide cults are a problem that always solve themselves...so, eh.
It's like some sort of Jenga. Except with men instead of blocks.
My manservent has been instructed to unexpectedly attack me at random times to keep my self-defense skills sharp and fresh.
Have you ever seen a 6'4" man crouching in a gutter pretending to be a potato leprechaun? No? You should get out more.
Never mistake my silence for weakness. No one plans a murder out loud.
You learn more if you don't knock.
I shouldn't tell you, it's gross. Alright, I'll tell you...I'm so glad we have boundaries.
C1: "Naked!" C2: "Maybe you should have warned me before you walked out of the bathroom."
C1: "You're an idiot." C2: "Never claimed otherwise."
Come on, let's pull socks over our hands and let them lead theological disputes.
C1: "It isn't allowed. I'm not supposed to care and neither are you." C2: "I think the rules may be on hold, considering the situation."
What part of 'I'm taking a bath' did you think meant 'come in'?

My fortune cookie just proposed to me.
Your character walks into a public restroom. There is a phone number on the wall. [S]he calls it, what happens?
Kumquats! Who stole my fucking kumquats?

Someone comes out of the closet, literally.
You burnt the cookies? You had one job!
Someone gets a papercut.
Someone happens upon a trial of some kind (candy, foot prints, dust,etc.). DO they follow? What happens if they do?
Something really small (like a coaster being out of place) sets one of the characters off uncharacteristically and it freaks everyone out.
Someone gets caught putting the empty milk jug back in the fridge.
There's nothing between us but air.
Now why would you do something like that?
It felt as if the entire world, all at once, decided to start ignoring me.
What made you think that I wasn't just pretending to care?
When I said 'make yourself at home', I didn't mean THAT."
Everything is free, if you steal it!
There is no part of my back that I can't reach to scratch. Seriously. Watch me.
That's what it's like being the lesser kind. You work twice as hard, so that one day you can be half as good as the rest.
Christmas already? Can't we enjoy Halloween first?
The mug shattered upon the floor; its contents spreading in all directions, much like the broken pieces of her life.
It's funny how much a conversation about the weather can reveal about someone.
She wasn't listening to him. He knew it by the wat she was swaying her hips.
C1: "I've lost you, haven't I?" C2: "Lost me? No. You haven't lost me. You never had me to begin with."
The post-it notes held endless imagination, stuck to the walls like miniature works of art.
I hereby make all of you my royal subjects.
Sir, you left your inflatable duck!
It shouldn't have mattered how it ended. The fact that it did should have been enough.
Keep each other safe. That's all we can do when the world turns against us.
Your task is not to fight, or to die, but to remember those who fight and die. For in the end, if no one remembers,their sacrifices were for nothing,
Love is like a key. A certain key unlocks a certain door, just as a certain kind of love unlocks a certain heart. The complicated part is that while a key unlocks only one door, one kind of love can unlock many hearts.
You didn't learn your history. It's going to repeat itself until it's heard.
All you need is love. ANd food, water, and shelter. ANd air. And community, good literature, and heavy rock music. But other than that, all you need is love.

He was certain the wind whispered his name.
He had called him a dickhead one too many times.

An otherwise healthy tree was sacrificed in the name of the yule season and dragged indoors with great difficulty and considerable mess.
The things that make us happy leave more unexplained than explained, spit bubbles at the top of the list.
"Don't worry [character's name], if you have anything I've never seen before I'll throw a brick at it."
C1: "I know you're only insulting me to hide the fact that you're in love with me!" C2: "Damn, you've seen right through me. I'm madly in love with you and I waited until you were happily settled down with an equally beautiful man before I did anything about it!"
Boy: "I know that you're only mean to me when I deserve it, and I like that you think I'm pretty." Girl: "Obscenely pretty." Boy: "You are too. Still love me?" Girl: "Yeah. If you can explain the theory behind [complicated idea] I'll wear a t-shirt proclaiming my love."
